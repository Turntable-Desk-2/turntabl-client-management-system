Turntabl Client Management System(TCMS)

Turntabl wants to build a Client Management System.

The Turntabl Client Management System (TCMS) must store the following information about clients:

    Name
    Address
    Telephone Number
    Email Address

This information must be persisted even when the application is not running.

There must be a Console application that allows me to search for clients by name, enter new client details, and delete a client.
